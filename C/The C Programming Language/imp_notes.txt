General
The compiler assumes that the return type is int if you fail to specify any return type.

Chapter - 1

An int is used instead of a char to read a character input so that we can be sure the variable is large enough to store the EOF variable.

EOF variable is defined by an integer in <stdio.h>. To be on the safer side and not causing an overflow an int is used.

Sometimes it's better to use a long. longs are atleast of 32 bytes in size. On some machines ints take up 16 bits. You might end up overflowing them with ease on some machines

The standard library ensures that an input text stream appears as a sequence of lines, each terminated by a newline.

for (nc = 0; getchar() != EOF; ++nc)
    ;

In case you need a for loop to be empty. It can be done this way. By definition the for loop needs a body. Therefore the ; after the for loop.

chars are just small integers (8 bits).

Functions are pass by value. They pass a temporary value. However when arrays are passed, only the address of the array is passed. There is no copying of array elements.
