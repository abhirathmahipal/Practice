A repo to help me become familiar with syntax, certain libraries and algorithms.

Not going to include any projects or workspaces here. Will mostly commit code which runs via a single file.

Eg:- 
	Various langauge featues of Python.
	BFS and DFS from HackerRank.
	Solutions to old programming contests.
	Java Collections.
	SDL's Inbuilt Functions.
