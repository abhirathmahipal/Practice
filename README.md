A repo to help me become familiar with syntax, certain libraries and algorithms.

Not a place for huge projects/workspaces. *Mostly for code that needs only one file.*

Example:-

	* Various langauge featues of Python.
	* BFS and DFS from HackerRank.
	* Java collections.
	* SDL's inbuilt functions.
	* Inheritance in C++.
	* Small tutorials that I find on the web.
